# LinearRegression

Short project to learn the basics of using Elixr with the NX library.
Predicting car efficiency using Linear Regression.
Guide used: https://agileandcode.com/linear-regression-with-elixir-and-nx
I have tried to improve and generisize functions in the guide as a learning exercise, as well as using the guide as a practical first introduction to learning Elixr and functional
programming languages.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `linear_regression` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:linear_regression, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/linear_regression>.
